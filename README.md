# Spigot Test Plugin
This is a test plugin for spigot. I test my plugin ideas in this.

## Avaliable commands:
1. /helloworld | Says Hello World! to you :)
2. /listinventory | Lists all of your items sorted by how many of them you have. Ex. 2 stacks of iron will be one row in the chat like this: IRON* 128
3. /leaderboard | Shows you the leaderboard.
